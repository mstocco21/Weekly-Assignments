## The G11 R1 and R2 cutadapt files were already created in the scratch directory, I used these in this lab. This repository starts 
## from copying and pasting those files into a special directory to be used for the de novo assembly

# cp G11_R1_cutadapt.fastq de_novo_assemblyRP/
# cp G11_R1_cutadapt.fastq de_novo_assemblyRP/
## This command moves the cutadapt files from the previous folder into the new de_novo_assemblyRP directly to make room for the next
## stage of the assignment.

# conda activate de_novo
## activates the Spade assembly tool, this will be the assembler uses as it provides de Bruijn graph processing and contig refinement at the 
## end of the process for better reads

# spades.py -k 21,51,71,91,111,127 --careful --pe1-1 G11_R1.cutadapt.fastq --pe1-2 G11_R2.cutadapt.fastq -o G11_spades_output
## Uses spade.py to create a new assembly from the cutadapt files from scratch and puts them into a fdirectory marked "G11_spades_output"
##

# cd G11_spades_output
# quast contigs.fasta -o Quast_contigs
## changes directory to the output and uses the quast genome assesment tool to store a quality report in the directory Quast_contigs
## winSCP was used to bring up the .html document so we could assess the quality ourselves.

## Some answers below
### Number of contigs: 119
### GC content: 57.89
### Largest contig: 302203
### N50: 110872
